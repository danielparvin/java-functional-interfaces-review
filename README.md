# Java Functional Interfaces Review

## Description
This is a simple, serverless React app to visually demonstrate the use of the functional interfaces in java.util.function.   
This uses [react-filterable-table](https://github.com/ianwitherow/react-filterable-table).   
Thanks to the author of [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/deploying-react-apps-github-pages) for guidance on how to deploy directly to GitHub pages using the `npm run deploy` command.

## Future Ideas
- Convert the array objects in FunctionalInterfaces to TypeScript objects.
- Replace compound string values (e.g. "double,double") in the FunctionalInterfaces with arrays of unique values (e.g. \["double", "double"\].
- Extend the FilterableTable to provide more modular filtering and sorting on the array values from the above idea.
